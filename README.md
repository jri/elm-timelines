# Elm Timelines

Elm Timelines is a user interface for the creation of timelines, written in Elm. You can use it e.g. as an aid for remembering your life. The special trait of Elm Timelines is that it deals with uncertainty. You're not supposed to enter dates but draw timespans within a timescale. If you're not (yet) certain about a timespan's begin or end you can add a range of uncertainty. Elm Timelines visualizes this as "fade-in" resp. "fade-out".

Despite Elm Timelines models and visualizes time it is not a calendar application. Instead Elm Timelines provides you a canvas for your mind e.g. for your personal memory process. By visualizing different aspects of your life e.g. living places, partners, projects, the screen may inspire you with new questions and jog your memory. However Elm Timelines does not force you into any topic and you can go to the future as well.
